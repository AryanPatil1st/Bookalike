      <h1>The Myth of Narcissus</h1>
      <p>Narcissus was a beautiful, young hunter, beloved by everyone who saw him. His beauty was so exceptional that those who laid eyes on him often fell deeply in love. However, Narcissus was indifferent to all who adored him. He believed no one could ever be worthy of his affection, and he rejected all advances—women and men alike—causing heartbreak and despair.
<br>
        One day, while wandering through the forest, Narcissus came across a serene pool of water. As he bent down to drink, he saw his own reflection for the first time. The image he saw was so captivating that he couldn’t tear himself away. He was struck by the beauty of the reflection, not realizing that it was, in fact, his own face. Narcissus believed he had encountered a divine being, an ideal lover. He became transfixed, staring endlessly at the figure in the water, falling deeper and deeper in love with the image he saw.</p>

      <h1>The Myth of Narcissus</h1>
      <p>As the days passed, Narcissus continued to gaze at his reflection, unable to leave. He became so entranced by it that he refused to eat, drink, or sleep. His body withered, and his strength faded. He longed to embrace the reflection, but every time he reached for it, the image would vanish as the water rippled. This caused him immense sorrow, yet he could not break free from his obsession.
<br>
        Unable to tear himself away from the reflection, Narcissus eventually died beside the pool, unable to look away from the idealized image he had fallen in love with. In his final moments, his heart broke as he realized he could never attain the love he sought—because it was love for himself, a love that would never be returned. Where he had died, a flower sprang up, with petals that resembled the shape of his head—this was the narcissus, a symbol of self-love and the tragic consequences of vanity.</p>
