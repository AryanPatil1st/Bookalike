      <h1>Epic Of Gilgamesh</h1>
      <p>Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk, is two-thirds divine and one-third human. He is initially a tyrannical ruler, using his power to oppress his people. The gods, hearing their pleas, create Enkidu, a wild man, to challenge Gilgamesh. Enkidu is wild, living with animals, but after encountering a temple prostitute, Shamhat, he becomes more humanized. He is eventually introduced to Gilgamesh, and they fight. Their battle ends in mutual respect and friendship, and together they embark on various adventures.
        <br>

        One of their major quests is to defeat Humbaba, the monstrous guardian of the Cedar Forest. With the help of the gods, they slay Humbaba and return to Uruk as heroes. However, their triumph angers the gods, and as a punishment, they decide to kill Enkidu. Enkidu becomes ill and dies, leaving Gilgamesh devastated and filled with sorrow</p>

      <h1>Epic Of Gilgamesh</h1>
      <p>Unable to accept the loss, Gilgamesh embarks on a journey in search of immortality. He travels to the farthest reaches of the world and meets Utnapishtim, the only human who survived a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity (a story that resembles the Biblical flood of Noah). Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that immortality is reserved for the gods, but he shares the secret of eternal life, a plant that grows at the bottom of the sea. Gilgamesh finds the plant, but on his way home, a serpent steals it, and with it, his hopes of immortality vanish.<br>

        In the end, Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, having realized that immortality is beyond human reach. Instead, he accepts the importance of living a full and meaningful life, leaving behind a legacy through his achievements and the city he built. The epic concludes with Gilgameshâ€™s acceptance of human mortality.</p>
