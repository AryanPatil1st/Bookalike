      <h1>The Gift of the Magi</h1>
      <p>

        One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bargaining with the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied.<br>
        
        Within that amount, Della counted it three times. On the last time, she stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 to buy her husband, Jim, a Christmas gift.<br>
        
        For a long time, she had been looking for a gift worthy of her beloved husband, but now, at the last minute, she was without anything. Jim was a poor man, and their tiny apartment barely sufficed for both of them. They had no extra money for gifts, and Della had to make a choice.
        <br>
        Finally, she made up her mind. She ran to the mirror and let her long, beautiful hair down. She brushed it out, then wrapped it up and went to the pawn shop. There, she sold her hair to the pawn broker for $20..</p>

      <p>With the money in hand, she hurried to the store and bought a fine, beautiful chain for Jim's most prized possession: his pocket watch, which had been passed down from his grandfather. It was the most expensive gift she could find, and she was thrilled to give it to him.<br>

        When Della arrived home, she saw Jim standing in front of the mirror. He had his watch in his hand, examining it. He, too, had been saving money for a gift. Della rushed over to him, but Jim stopped her.
        <br>
        He, too, had a gift for her: a set of combs for her long hair. They were beautiful, made of tortoiseshell, and the best combs that money could buy. But Della’s hair was gone.
        <br>
        At first, there was a moment of silence. Then, Jim smiled. He wasn’t angry or upset. He, too, had sold his most prized possession—the pocket watch—to buy Della the combs she had wanted.
        <br>
        Della smiled, too. And together, they realized that their love for each other was far more valuable than any material gift.</p>
